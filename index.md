## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/20524039?s=400&v=4">

I am currently a PhD candidate at [Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian](https://cfa.harvard.edu) working with [prof. Daniel Eisenstein](https://scholar.harvard.edu/deisenstein).
I am planning to graduate in May 2025 and I am applying for postdoctoral positions.

I have developed the covariance matrix pipeline for 2-point correlation function for [the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://desi.lbl.gov) 2024 baryon acoustic oscillations measurements, and I am continuing this work for the ongoing analysis of the 3-year DESI data.
I am also working on selection/weighting of DESI galaxies based on a thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich map to extract more information from galaxy clustering.
Earlier, I finished a project on small-scale baryon inhomogeneities at recombination time as a possible relief of Hubble tension.

Before this I earned a B.Sc. degree in Physics in August 2020 from [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il), where I worked with [Dr. Omer Bromberg](https://physics.tau.ac.il/profile/omerbr) on relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of highly magnetized astrophysical jets propagating in a medium.
Earlier I studied at Department of General and Applied Physics of [Moscow Insitute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/) and worked with prof. Vasily Beskin on radiopulsar statistics and losses mechanism.

Another field of my interest are principles of quantum theory.

See the dedicated pages for more details on [research experience](research) or [biography](bio).

I am also known as Mykhailo Rashkovetskyi (officially, Ukrainian) and Mikhail Mikhailovich Rashkovetskiy (Russian).
