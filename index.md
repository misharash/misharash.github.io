## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/20524039?s=400&v=4">

Hello! I am currently a third year student of B.Sc. Physics at [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il), expect to earn the degree in summer 2020 and then continue to M.Sc. or Ph.D.

## Research Interests

I am highly interested in astrophysics. I have experience in compact object, plasma, high-energy and am acquainted with conducting and analyzing numerical simulations (see [Research](research) for more details). I am also excited about cosmology and analytical methods. Another field of my interest are principles of quantum theory.
