## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/20524039?s=400&v=4">

I am a [Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP)](https://ccapp.osu.edu/) postdoctoral fellow at [the Ohio State University](https://physics.osu.edu/).
I am currently working on the splitting of [the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://desi.lbl.gov) galaxies based on a thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich map to extract more information from galaxy clustering ([link for more details](research#clustering-of-spectroscopic-desi-galaxies-split-by-thermal-sunyaev-zeldovich-effect)).

I defended my PhD in May 2025 at [Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian](https://cfa.harvard.edu) with [prof. Daniel Eisenstein](https://scholar.harvard.edu/deisenstein).
I have developed [the covariance matrix pipeline]((research#semi-analytical-covariance-matrices-for-desi-2-point-correlation-functions)) for 2-point correlation function for [DESI](https://desi.lbl.gov) 2024 (DR1) and DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations measurements.
Earlier, I conducted [a follow-up study of small-scale baryon inhomogeneities at recombination time as a possible relief of Hubble tension](research#inhomogeneous-recombination-relieving-hubble-tension).

Before this I earned a B.Sc. degree in Physics in August 2020 from [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il), where I worked with [Dr. Omer Bromberg](https://physics.tau.ac.il/profile/omerbr) on [relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of highly magnetized astrophysical jets propagating in a medium](research#dynamics-of-highly-magnetized-jets-propagating-in-a-medium).
Earlier I studied at Department of General and Applied Physics of [Moscow Insitute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/) and worked with prof. Vasily Beskin on [radiopulsar statistics](research#orthogonal-radiopulsars-and-their-statistics) and [losses mechanism](research#pulsar-losses-mechanisms).

Another field of my interest are principles of quantum theory.

See the dedicated pages for more details on [research experience](research) or [biography](bio).

I am also known as Mykhailo Rashkovetskyi (officially, Ukrainian) and Mikhail Mikhailovich Rashkovetskiy (Russian).
