I am currently a PhD student at [Astronomy department of Harvard University](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu).

I was born in Odesa, Ukraine, graduated from Physics class of [Richelieu Lyceum](http://rl.odessa.ua/index.php/uk/) there in 2015 and started college at Department of General and Applied Physics of [Moscow Insitute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/). I continued my studies at [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il) and earned a B.Sc. degree in Physics in August 2020.

I am also known as Mykhailo Rashkovetskyi (officially, Ukrainian) and Mikhail Mikhailovich Rashkovetskiy (Russian).

## Research Interests

I am highly interested in astrophysics.

I have experience in compact objects, plasma, high-energy and am acquainted with conducting and analyzing numerical simulations (see [Research](research) for more details).

I am excited about cosmology and analytical methods. Another field of my interest are principles of quantum theory.
