## Research projects

### The dynamics of highly magnetized jets propagating in the medium

(Dr. Omer Bromberg, Prof. Alexander Tchekhovkoy)

**Goal**: study their propagation, instabilities, energy dissipation

**Tools**: GRMHD simulations in H-AMR code (improved version of HARM)

**My contribution**: implementing the rotating perfect conductor BC, matter injection, grid modifications, tilting the jet to avoid pole singularity issues

### Pulsar losses mechanisms

(Prof. Vasily Beskin, Dr. Alexander Philippov)

**Goal**: understanding the reason of discrepancy between numerical simulations and theoretical considerations - the first give that total energy loss rate increases with inclination angle (between magnetic dipole and rotation axis), while the second gave the opposite trend

**Key results**: additional separatrix currents are important factor of radiopulsar losses reproduced in simulations; most of the energy starts flowing along open magnetic field lines already within the light cylinder; losses in numerical simulations are not dipolar

**My contribution**: analysis of electromagnetic field configuration in a force-free simulation snapshot; a method to separate polar cap from closed field lines region

### Radiopulsar statistics

(Prof. Vasily Beskin, Egor Novoselov, Alisa Galishnikova, Dr. Anton Biryukov)

**Goal**: test two key models of radiopulsar period and inclination angle evolution (one theoretical by Beskin, Gurevich and Istomin (BGI) with one based on MHD and force-free simulations by Spitkovsky, Tchekhovskoy, Philippov and others) by predicting seen orthogonal pulsar numbers and comparing them to observed ones

**My contribution**: sampling pulsar distribution functions with Monte-Carlo simulation, making predictions based on it

### Pulsar radiation propagation

(Prof. Vasily Beskin, Dr. Alexander Philippov)

**Goal**: understand the morphology of pulsar light-curves; find observational evidence of separatrix currents

**Method**: ray-tracing and integrating the polarization parameters according to Kravtsov-Orlov equation
